MISSION_DETAIL_1
	"One of the enemy's top Generals is devising a remarkably fiendish plan from his covert base of operations.\n"
	"\n"
	"Thanks to recon, we have located the position of this base and require you to assassinate him before his plans can become operational. \n"
	"\n"
	"We expect that the enemy have intercepted this transmission and are preparing for your arrival, so extreme caution is required."
MISSION_DETAIL_2
	"Your troops have stumbled upon an enemy supply zone. \n"
	"\n"
	"Capture the area and plunder as much weaponry as possible to aid your cause. \n"
	"\n"
	"Be fast and efficient and keep your eye on the clock since we're gonna nuke the hell out of the place!"
MISSION_DETAIL_3
	"Following the success of your last mission the enemy is now on the defensive. \n"
	"\n"
	"Your limited arsenal of weaponry should be sufficient to eliminate the enemy, but weapons supply drops are en-route so sit tight. \n"
	"\n"
	"Whilst you may appear to have the upper hand, do not get complacent."
MISSION_DETAIL_4
	"On arrival at the mission's rally point you will find your enemy dug in and resistant. \n"
	"\n"
	"Use the supplies dropped prior to your arrival to eliminate the enemy and halt their sinister chemical weapons production. \n"
	"\n"
	"Beware contamination.\n"
	"\n"
	"Put the enemy out of action ... permanently!"
MISSION_DETAIL_5
	"An informant has indicated the enemy is about to renew an old campaign of terror. Their first target is to be a city official, a Worm renowned for its political importance. Unfortunately this comes at a most awkward time as the area is currently under siege of a fragmenting comet, which has decided to use the city as its landing zone.\n"
	"\n"
	"We can estimate that after 5 minutes some of these comet fragments will make an unwelcome appearance.\n"
	"\n"
	"Time is an additional enemy; save the politician and clear the area of our foes so we can evacuate the city."
MISSION_DETAIL_6
	"This mission requires a good dose of skill and guile to successfully complete. \n"
	"\n"
	"Guide your paratroopers down to the enemy and deal a swift and decisive blow to eliminate them.\n"
	"\n"
	"Secure the area, over and out."
MISSION_DETAIL_7
	"An experimental weapon can be found in a crate to be delivered to a specific zone in this area.\n"
	"\n"
	"The top of the pyramid in this area has previously been used as an important drop point for incoming materials and equipment. We advise you promptly secure this location in preparation for its delivery. \n"
	"\n"
	"We will monitor the airways and keep you notified as to the expected time of arrival for the all-important delivery."
MISSION_DETAIL_8
	"Scale those heights and get the much-needed weaponry to aid your quest to dig down and kill the captain of the enemy. \n"
	"\n"
	"Be careful; his subordinates won't want to let that happen so easily.."
MISSION_DETAIL_9
	"This one could be a mathematical nightmare, with angles and variables it could be enough to demoralise even the most resilient Worm. \n"
	"\n"
	"However, persistence and a little luck may win the day, giving our forces a much needed morale-boosting victory.\n"
	"\n"
	"Don't waste time and get on with the job; the 3 minute warning has just sounded."
MISSION_DETAIL_10
	"This mission involves one Worm with an unlimited supply of shotgun bullets. \n"
	"\n"
	"There is a time limit, so move quickly to destroy the enemy and reach high ground.\n"
	"\n"
	"This where all that rifle range practise comes in useful.\n"
	"\n"
	"You did train didn't you? I hope so..."
MISSION_DETAIL_11
	"Your goal is to eliminate all the enemy Worms.\n"
	"\n"
	"Keep an eye out for special deliveries. Sturdy positioning is highly recommended as geometric reports suggest the area is susceptible to earth tremors; we'll try and warn you if one looks likely!\n"
	"\n"
	"You start with 2 Worms and there is no time limit, which means little pressure, but beware the enemy will not be quite so relaxed..."
MISSION_DETAIL_12
	"Defying gravity is perhaps the most unlikely solution to this little mission. \n"
	"\n"
	"The enemy is entrenched around the goal of this mission, a crate which contains a powerful weapon that could help bring a swift end to this conflict."
MISSION_DETAIL_13
	"A bold and daring approach is required to successfully complete this mission. \n"
	"\n"
	"Grab what you can and obtain the secret weapon located in the bottom left corner of the battle zone. \n"
	"\n"
	"Success in this mission could tip the balance of power in our favour."
MISSION_DETAIL_14
	"This could prove to be a tough one. \n"
	"\n"
	"Sharp reflexes and quick thinking are the key to success in this mission. \n"
	"\n"
	"The enemy is particularly vigilant here, so your movement time has been shaved to a minimum.\n"
	"\n"
	"We will try to aid you the best we can by supplying utilities to minimise their impact...\n"
	"\n"
	"Blow them to hell and back."
MISSION_DETAIL_15
	"In this mission you must destroy the crate guarded by the enemy. \n"
	"\n"
	"It contains a deadly weapon that the enemy was researching.\n"
	"\n"
	"You start with a crippled Worm, unaccustomed to the odd terrain. \n"
	"\n"
	"You have 3 minutes in which to complete this mission."
MISSION_DETAIL_16
	"A breakaway faction of the enemy has infiltrated a base amongst one of the most prestigious monuments in the world. \n"
	"\n"
	"The government of this location have expressed great contempt for this action and require the skill and expertise of your commandos to remove this threat.\n"
	"\n"
	"The leader of the faction simply calls itself General, a former head of the enemy forces; the General is your primary target. \n"
	"\n"
	"Eliminate him and the rest of the followers will surrender."
MISSION_DETAIL_17
	"Phase one of this mission has gone horribly wrong and the air-dropped weaponry supplies have fallen into enemy hands.\n"
	"\n"
	"Your Worms have been left with only a few utilities and close combat weapons with which to destroy the enemy and retrieve the crates.\n"
	"\n"
	"The enemy has placed the stolen supplies into what it believes are a secured location. \n"
	"\n"
	"However, clever use of  the resources you have will prove that this not the case."
MISSION_DETAIL_18
	"The conflict has reached that point were supplies become short and weapons in demand. \n"
	"\n"
	"Unfortunately we only have one trusty weapon at this time. \n"
	"\n"
	"The bazooka still has one or two tricks it can show the enemy, so take what you've got and give 'em hell!"
MISSION_DETAIL_19
	"A member of the enemy's elite command staff is hidden away with the belief that this Worm is untouchable. \n"
	"\n"
	"We consider this to be an attempt to make a mockery of our authority and armed forces.\n"
	"\n"
	"You must prove them wrong. Using the few weapons we provide, quash this belief once and for all.\n"
	"\n"
	"You will demonstrate that our forces are superior, inventive and that no enemy should ever underestimate our resolve again."
MISSION_DETAIL_20
	"Information is limited in this battlefield.\n"
	"\n"
	"It seems our best efforts to recon the area have been met with lethal force. \n"
	"\n"
	"We believe there may be a small stockade of a new type of weapon at this location. \n"
	"\n"
	"Find and secure it to strike a decisive blow."
MISSION_DETAIL_21
	"Your goal is to eliminate all other Worms.\n"
	"\n"
	"A single unit is all you have. \n"
	"\n"
	"Keep your wits about you and don't hang about for too long.\n"
	"\n"
	"Make good use of the limited resources you have; it's a case of brains before brawn.\n"
	"\n"
	"You have 5 minutes to complete the task before the land begins to sink.\n"
	"\n"
	"Watch yourself out there."
MISSION_DETAIL_22
	"In this mission you must retrieve the special weapons crate being held on the far right of the landscape.\n"
	"\n"
	"You start with only one Worm and limited weapons; use them wisely.\n"
	"\n"
	"Use Ninja Ropes and Girders to avoid the mines.\n"
	"\n"
	"An Earthquake could strike at any time."
MISSION_DETAIL_23
	"Ambush!  \n"
	"\n"
	"The enemy has been taken totally by surprise; use this element of surprise to press your advantage and batter the enemy where they stand. \n"
	"\n"
	"We'll help you where we can with supplies.\n"
	"\n"
	"This is quite simply a fight for survival.\n"
	"\n"
	"Eliminate or be eliminated."
MISSION_DETAIL_24
	"You take over this mission as the situation becomes critical. \n"
	"\n"
	"The Commandos have just succeeded in retrieving sensitive information from a grounded sub but have unfortunately lost their commander and require immediate assistance. \n"
	"\n"
	"The enemy is closing in but the greater threat will come from the tide, which is gradually rising.\n"
	"\n"
	"Get them to high ground and quick!"
MISSION_DETAIL_25
	"This mission needs to involve the use of some accurate shooting if you are to succeed and clever use of our fluffy friends.\n"
	"\n"
	"Enemy supplies scattered throughout the area will provide any of the extra munitions you may require.\n"
	"\n"
	"However, should things get too sticky then we will lend assistance. \n"
	"\n"
	"Be prepared for the worst."
MISSION_DETAIL_26
	"This mission requires tremendous skill to navigate the cavern using your only available weapon. \n"
	"\n"
	"Your friend will collect the required weapon needed to successfully remove the enemy threat."
MISSION_DETAIL_27
	"Agent Dennis has been ambushed; the enemy know his location and have detached a small task force to eliminate him.\n"
	"\n"
	"Although our agent is a monster of a Worm and a fine specimen too, he is not too well endowed in the brains department.\n"
	"\n"
	"Use all of your cunning and guile to see this one through to the end and bring him back alive."
MISSION_DETAIL_28
	"After sending in a group of our own crack troops to retrieve a scientist abducted by the enemy our troops have broken radio silence and are now requesting instructions for the final phase of their mission.\n"
	"\n"
	"This is where you come in. \n"
	"\n"
	"It is paramount that the scientist survives at any cost.\n"
	"\n"
	"This would be straightforward but for the enemy, who are in hot pursuit and determined not to let the scientist escape."
MISSION_DETAIL_29
	"Collect the secret crate guarded by the enemy; it contains a weapon vital to a later mission. Watch out for the mined area.\n"
	"\n"
	"There is no time limit, but we advise you to hurry up..."
MISSION_DETAIL_30
	"A renegade enemy soldier is holding the earth to ransom, threatening to blow up the south pole!\n"
	"\n"
	"For mission success you need to act quickly and decisively. \n"
	"\n"
	"Time is running out and we fear an imminent attack in this zone. \n"
	"\n"
	"You need to find out what weapons you need to perform that task... a utility may be useful!\n"
	"\n"
	"Kill the soldier, restore order and avert calamity!"
MISSION_DETAIL_31
	"At an abandoned train yard a locomotive stands idle. This vehicle has been requisitioned by those who would plot against our organisation.\n"
	"\n"
	"Amongst the scrap of the locomotive sits a crate containing what can only be described as a destructive force like we have never seen. We need you to use a specially trained infiltration Worm to collect this crate and give our R&D boys another new weapon to toy with."
MISSION_DETAIL_32
	"An agent has infiltrated our HQ, stolen some important tapes and attached them to a weather balloon, which is intended for enemy aircraft pickup. \n"
	"\n"
	"We have tracked the balloon and know that not all has gone to plan for the enemy.\n"
	"\n"
	"The balloon is slowly descending and will free fall into the ocean. \n"
	"\n"
	"Use girders to prevent the crate's destruction and collect it once successful."
MISSION_DETAIL_33
	"Run for the hills. \n"
	"\n"
	"Noah is nowhere to be seen and the water lapping round your ankles and rapidly rising. \n"
	"\n"
	"Combine your weapons and utilities for maximum effect. \n"
	"\n"
	"We strongly urge you use a combination of girder and ropes to make your way to the safety of the cavern ceiling."
